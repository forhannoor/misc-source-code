<p>Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) originally referred to the mean solar time at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London, 
which later became adopted as a global time standard. It is for the most part the same as <?php echo anchor('time/utc', 'Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)') ?>, 
and when this is viewed as a time zone, the name Greenwich Mean Time is especially used by bodies connected with the United Kingdom, 
such as the BBC World Service, the Royal Navy, the Met Office and others particularly in Arab countries, such as the Middle East Broadcasting Center and OSN. 
It is the term in common use in the United Kingdom and countries of the Commonwealth, including Australia, South Africa, India, Pakistan and Malaysia, and many other countries in the Eastern Hemisphere.</p>
